## program description

this program overall function is to convert user input into pig latin for the sake of fun. 

I created this program to demonstrate

* list iteration
* conditional
* operations
* functions
* but mostly string manipulation 

spicificly in the python language 


## programs creation

this program was created using visual studio code, using the python extention
* this program contains four functions. 
* one to capture the users input
* one to seperate the text into a list of strings
* one to iterate through the strings and return the pig latin translations
* and one last function to display the last sentence

## how to use the program 

when you run the program you will be prompted to enter a word or sentence.
after you press enter the program will display what you wrote now in pig latin. 
some things to note.

1. when you enter a integer the number will not be edited.

1. the program will do its best to maintain the integrety of the phonics. so words starting with two constenents will retain the first to letters
word example.
